Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "> The project uses publicly available app reviews that were written voluntarily by the users. The reviewers did not provide informed consent for their review to be used in research, but the data was collected publically from the Google Play store with no private information being collected. In those places you can only see a user’s username. The people who got their reviews scrapped may not have posted it if they knew that it would be used as data for our research question, so we will be analyzing the text of the review without any private information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We recognize that a user who leaves reviews may not be the same as a person who doesn’t leave reviews. People who leave reviews are likely to report extreme positive or negative experiences, so their language may not reflect the population.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> User data such as usernames will be cleaned to not show any personal information.\n",

    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> We are not collecting protected attributes. That information is not displayed and even if it was available it was not going to be used because it is not a part of our analysis.\n",

    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The security is not too advanced but the data will be stored on a private GitHub repo with our group members and the TAs being able to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> The analysis only focuses on users who choose to leave written reviews, which may exclude the perspective of users who have downloaded and use the app but haven’t left a review. Also during our meetings, we have decided to scrape only Google Play reviews and not App Store anymore due to the App Store being more difficult, meaning Apple users may be excluded.\n",

    " - [ ] gate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> The text of the reviews may be biased by cultural and linguistic differences in how people talk. Even if we take only English reviews, there are many different places that speak English differently in how they speak and text. For example, some cultures may use “thank you” more often out of habit rather than treating the AI like a human.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> We are not analyzing data with PPI. It is just the raw text of their reviews. This means that no private information is being used, and therefore the analysis will be in privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> The sentiment analysis analyzes the reviews in English, so non-English reviews will have to be translated. Translation is not perfect and meanings and intent can be lost during translation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Our analysis uses a model from GitHub to classify text as \"anthropomorphic\" or “instrumental”. To ensure explainability, we have reviewed the repository’s documentation and tried to understand how it works. We can justify the model’s decision making by looking at some of the reviews and comparing the score to what we would expect to see if the logic aligns with how we think.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> The way the score of the user reviews is inferred from the language algorithm and is not a definitive measure of a users’ belief. The analysis is correlational and limited to English reviews from the platform and the AI app. Therefore, the results may not generalize to all people who use AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> The app review data was scrapped and stored in a CSV file for analysis. This means it is a static dataset and does not have a deployable model that doesn't have to be rolled back and we are not monitoring the model. Because of this, the risk of unintended use is minimal. We are just analyzing the reviews for our project. "
